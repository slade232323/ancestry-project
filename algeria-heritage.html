            <h2>Culture and Language</h2>
            <p>The dual culture between Arabic and French is prevalent in Algerian society. There is intensive use of the French language by citizens, especially in the northern coastal cities, despite the consolidation of the Arabic language in all stages of school and university education.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Capital</h2>
            <p>The capital of the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria is "Algeria," a coastal city in the middle of the Gulf overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. It is full of historical and tourist attractions, and its urban architecture varies between the old neighborhoods dating back to the Turkish era and buildings established during the French colonial period. The authorities are trying to restore them despite their artistic life expiring. Modern neighborhoods were built after independence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Administrative Divisions</h2>
            <p>According to the administrative division of the country, there are 48 wilayas in Algeria, the most important being Constantine (east of the capital), Oran, and Tipaza, which are known for their archaeological coastal areas and the oil tanker.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Economic Activity</h2>
            <p>Economic activity is concentrated on trade and fishing. Some industrial areas located in the suburbs of Rouiba and Réghaia are directly linked to Algiers via railways. Algeria enjoys large tourist attractions but they are poorly exploited.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Religion and Population</h2>
            <p>Most Algerians believe in Islam, mainly following the Maliki school. There is a class of Mozabite, Badina, and Ghardaïa tribes who follow the Ibadi doctrine in addition to some Christians and Jews. The majority of the population is mainly Arab and Amazigh tribes (Berber, Chaoui, and Touareg), with the population exceeding 40 million.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Heritage</h2>
            <p>The Algerian heritage derives its importance from its historical depth. Algeria maintains a great Amazigh heritage that reflects the traditions of the Berber tribes. In the last constitutional amendment, the Amazigh language was adopted as a national and official language in the country, although it is not used in administration but is taught in schools. Moreover, it reflects Arab and Islamic heritage with mosques, palaces, monuments, manuscripts, and books in various fields of science. The country attaches great importance to the preservation and protection of Algerian heritage.</p>
